<h1>Instagram Phishing 2024 - **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY** 🚨 <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bde96cd3-1bdb-4d26-ae1b-7c401ac7f7d6" alt="Instagram Logo" width="70px" /> </h1> 
<h2>📜 Description</h2> 

<p>This educational project simulates an Instagram password recovery phishing attack. The idea is to make users believe that their account is in danger, prompting them to quickly enter their login details on a fake form. This technique plays on urgency and fear.</p> <p>The form mimics a legitimate password recovery page, but instead of helping recover an account, it is designed to collect user credentials.</p> 

<h2>📂 Contents</h2>

<ul> 
  <li><strong>index.php</strong>: Contains the HTML and PHP code responsible for the form and backend operations.</li>
  <li><strong>registro.css</strong>: The CSS file for styling the form to appear credible and professional.</li> 
  <li><strong>Pictures</strong>: Images used in the project to make the phishing page look more realistic.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>⚙️ How it Works</h2> 

<p>The project involves setting up a local MySQL database (e.g., using XAMPP or Apache) and connecting it to the HTML form via PHP. When a user enters their Instagram credentials, these are stored in the database.</p> <p>In a real-world phishing attack, scammers would need to deploy the form on a live web domain. However, this project is meant to be run locally (<strong>localhost</strong>) to demonstrate the process in a controlled environment.</p>

<h2>🔒 Conclusion: </h2>
<p>While this project is purely for educational purposes, it highlights the importance of staying vigilant about where you enter your personal data. Scammers often create websites that look identical to legitimate ones to steal sensitive information like usernames and passwords.</p> <p> Always verify the URL and make sure you're on the legitimate website. Even a small mistake can lead to significant consequences, such as loss of account access or personal data exposure.</p>
